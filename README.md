# Refactoring Lab: PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python)

Exercise from [SPD 2.3 syllabus](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-4931-Testing-and-Architecture/tree/master/exercises/pep8-refactor)

In this series of exercises, we learn how to refactor code for better readability according to PEP 8 guidelines.

## TODO
- [x] Activity 1: Fix Indentation [indentation.py](01_indentation.py)  
 
    Consider the following guidelines:
    - Use `4 spaces` per indentation level.
    - Maximum line length is `79 characters`.
    - Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent. Refer to class slides for visual explanation.

- [x] Activity 2: Fix Whitespaces and Naming Convention [whitespace_naming_conventions.py](02_whitespace_naming_conventions.py)


- [x] Activity 3: Add Docstrings [docstrings_blank_lines.py](03_docstrings_blank_lines.py)
  - Fix any other issues discussed in this document (if you find any).
